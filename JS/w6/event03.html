            The third patch of the MapleStory NEXT update has been released, featuring the new boss, Baldrix, Apostle of
            Darmoor! They actually lowered his HP a bit from test -> live, in both Normal and Hard Mode. It also
            contains
            new features such as the Cross World Boss Content system and various quality of life improvements.
            The next official server patch is on March 20, for the addition of the new Destiny Weapon, so we can expect

            KMST update on March 13.
            The Apostle Baldrix appears before the Adversary to seize the power of the ancient gods in Tallahart. A
